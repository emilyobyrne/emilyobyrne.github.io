		      			<h2>Gathering inspiration</h2>			
						<p>In my first UXDI project I designed an app for my colleague Phil, a musician who likes to get together with his friends to play music. They find it difficult to agree which songs they will play, so I designed an app to help out. Musicians can suggest songs and vote and comment on other people's suggestions. The initial prototype was developed with sketched wireframes linked up in POP. For this project, I'm focusing on the visual design for the app.</p>
						<p>First off, I checked in with Phil to find out what kinds of music magazines and websites he likes (Kerrang and Metal Hammer), and where he'd be using the app (on trains, in odd moments, and in rehearsal rooms that don't always have great lighting). This conversation gave me plenty of search words to get started. I also listed out word associations for 'play', 'music' and 'together' to get more ideas for a mood board. I gathered a heap of images in Keynote to start with, and then used paper boards to help clarify my theme.</p>

		      			<h2>Sketching ideas</h2>			
						<p>The palette that emerged was based on black and white, with warm browns and golds coming from the wooden instruments and studio walls and floors. The typography is handwritten and a bit scruffy. I noticed that where a cleaner typeface is used, it tends to be a chunky sans serif reminiscent of the stencilling on road cases.</p>
						<p>At this stage, I resketched the wireframes I planned to work on. In the original prototype I'd used text buttons for clarity, and redrawing the interface with icons helped me to assess how much room on the screen there would be for different elements. I also played with some ideas for icons, based on the word games I'd done earlier.</p>

			      		<h2>Initial design</h2>
						<p>Thinking back to where and when Phil was likely to be using the app, I decided on high contrast text so it would be easy to read in darker places. Thinking about 'night mode' apps, I started with a dark screen. To rough it up a bit, I used a grunge typeface for the headings, and a textured overlay for the background.</p>			
						<p>In this first version, I also tried out plectrum-shaped profile pictures. Phil and other guitarists in the room liked this a lot, but a drummer took instant offence. You can see in the third screen where I'm trying a mix of shapes, and I think this just looks untidy.</p>
						<p>A bigger problem was that the plectrum shape is difficult to discern when the photo has a dark background. Additionally, the overall feel is rather gloomy, and it's hard to see what elements are interactive because everything looks the same. I went back to my mood board, and noticed the picture of the Marshall amp, which combines black and light gold in equal parts. That became the basis for the next version.</p>

				    	<h2>Improvements based on initial testing</h2>	
						<p>It's now easier to guess the gold coloured part scrolls underneath the darker sections. The dark grey is now flat; combined with larger font sizes that allows the grunge typeface to show up better.</p>		
						<p>This version tested well from a style point of view: when asked to match it to one of 9 rock and pop acts all my testers picked Nirvana. Although one tester put it on the Nirvana/Metallica boundary and noted that if you weren't into grunge and heavy metal you might find the user interface a bit off-putting.</p>

				<div class="item">
			    	<div class="portfolio-carousel-caption">		
						<h2>The final design</h2>
						<p>I also wanted to check that the design was reading as grungey, not just messy, so I asked testers to look at a sheet of words and pick out a few that matched their impressions of the app. No votes for 'untidy, thankfully.</p>
						<p>I did however get some good feedback in these conversations about what looked tappable (or not), and on icon placement (put them where the user expect them!). The swipe to delete action was easily understood but users questioned how it would be discovered. I also confirmed my suspicion that the 'download tab' and 'download lyrics' icons were incomprehensible.</p>
						<p>So, in version 3 I added little bits of shadow on the black text and dividers, and a new delete icon that looks rather like a screw head. The scrolling layer is now pleasingly reminiscent of a fretboard. I also moved the actions on the song screen up to the song title, so it's clear what you are taking action on, and I redesigned the home screen to be more about the musician.</p>

					<h2>Experimenting with different styles</h2>
						<p>As always, testing with users gave me lots more ideas as well as highlighting problems with the design. The one I wanted to follow up on immediately was alternative skins for different musicians. This version is very grunge; how might a folk musician want their app to look? Or a fan of bluegrass and Americana?</p>
						<p>These next two versions took about an hour each. I pulled a load of images from a single Google search to create a mood board in Keynote, and then used the colours and typefaces to mock up a single screen in Sketch. If nothing else, it's a useful demonstration of how fast Sketch can be when you need to change the look of your mockups.</p>

    		<h1>About me</h1>
    		<p>From March 2015, I will be studying User Experience Design at General Assembly in London. I’ve spent the last ten years in Marketing and in Employee Communications, doing my best to design and deliver campaigns that amuse and educate audiences, build communities, and make complex things seem simple. But sometimes great communication isn’t enough: the best marketing campaign in the world can’t sell a poorly designed product or convince employees to work with a difficult business process. As a designer my purpose isn’t to make complex things seem simple; it’s to make them really simple, and a joy to use as well.</p>
    		<p>Before I moved into marketing, I worked as a software developer, project manager, and management consultant. I tackled projects from bespoke systems delivery to organisation redesign, writing code to teaching development methods, working solo and as part of complex and often multinational and geographically distributed project teams. I recently spent three months working in an agile development team, so I can now add Scrum to the list of methods I’ve tried and applied, including IBM's GS Method and Prince 2. I’m happy to work with variety of team structures and approaches and I enjoy trying new ways of working, so long as there is clarity of purpose, candid communication, and the right mix of skills, experience, and common sense to get the job done well.</p>
    		<p>I live and work in London, UK, and I'll be available from 1 June 2015.</p>
